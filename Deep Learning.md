**Deep Learning**

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn patterns from large datasets. It enables systems to perform tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, language translation, and intelligent decision-making.

**Main Model Types**

1) **ANN** – Basic neural networks for classification and prediction

2) **CNN** – Designed for image and visual data

3) **RNN** – Handles sequential data (text, speech, time-series)

4) **Generative Models (GANs, Autoencoders)** – Generate new data

**Why Use Deep Learning?**

Automatic feature extraction

High accuracy with large data

Handles complex, non-linear problems

**Applications**

Healthcare, Finance, Technology, Automotive, Entertainment
