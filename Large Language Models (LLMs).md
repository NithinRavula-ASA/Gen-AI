Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on massive text data to understand and generate human language. They learn patterns in language to perform tasks like answering questions, summarizing text, translating languages, generating content, and more.

**How LLMs Work**

1) Text is converted into tokens → numerical vectors

2) Model analyzes relationships using attention mechanisms

3) Predicts the most probable next token

4) Repeats to generate full responses

LLMs don’t “know” answers like humans—they predict the most likely response based on learned patterns.

**Why Use LLMs?**

--> Understand and generate human-like text

--> Perform multiple language tasks without retraining

--> Automate tasks previously requiring human effort

**Common Applications**

Customer Support: chatbots, virtual assistants

Education: tutoring, explanations

Healthcare: medical document analysis

Software Dev: code generation, debugging

Business & Finance: reports, document summarization

**How Models Like GPT Work**

1) **Pre-Training**: learns grammar, facts, reasoning from large datasets

2) **Fine-Tuning**: adjusts model for safety, accuracy, and instruction-following

3) **Inference**: generates responses based on user prompts

**Key Abilities** : Text generation & summarization , Question answering & reasoning  , Translation , Code generation

LLMs are AI tools that predict language patterns to generate human-like responses and automate text-related tasks.
