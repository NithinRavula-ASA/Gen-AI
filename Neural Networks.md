**Neural Networks**

A Neural Network (Artificial Neural Network – ANN) is a computational model inspired by the human brain.
It consists of interconnected layers of neurons that process input data, learn patterns, and produce outputs by adjusting internal weights during training.

**Types of Neural Networks**

1) **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** – One-directional data flow (input → output); used for classification and prediction.

2) **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** – Designed for image and spatial data processing.

3) **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** – Handles sequential data such as text and speech.

4) **Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)** – Used for function approximation and time-series prediction.

5) **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)** – Unsupervised model for clustering and data visualization.

**Why Use Neural Networks?**

Learn complex, non-linear patterns, Improve with more data , Automatically extract features , Generalize to new, unseen data

**Applications**

Healthcare, Finance, Technology, Transportation, Business Intelligence
