**Prompt Engineering** is the art of crafting instructions (prompts) so AI produces accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

Better prompt → Better AI output.

**Types of Prompting:**

1) ** Zero-Shot**: Task given without examples. Use for simple tasks.
Example: “Summarize this text in 3 lines.”

2) **One-Shot**: Provide one example to guide format/style.
Example: Translate “Hello → Hola; Good morning → ?” → “Buenos días”

3) **Few-Shot**: Multiple examples for structured or complex tasks.
Example: Translate several phrases to maintain consistency.

4) **Instruction-Based**: Clear, detailed instructions including tone, style, or length.
Example: “Explain machine learning for a 10-year-old.”

5) **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Ask AI to reason step by step for complex problems.
Example: Solve math problems showing all steps.

**Why Use It** : Improves accuracy, Reduces irrelevant/incorrect answers, Controls tone, format, and detail, Makes outputs more predictable

**Where It’s Used**: AI development, coding, content creation, customer support, education, and data analysis.
